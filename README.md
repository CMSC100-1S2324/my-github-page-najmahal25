Steps on how to create GitHub page

1. Create your repository (not needed if the repository is given to you)

2. clone the repository to your local machine

3. add initial files for your Github Pages (html, css, etc.)

4. Add, commit, and push it to your remote repository (remember to configure user.name and user.email in Git in order for your account to reflect in GitHub)

5. Go to your repository settings, under code and automation, click Pages. 

6. Enable Deployment of the said repository to your site.

7. After a while, check if the initial file you created is reflected in your GitHub Pages.

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
- One of my key takeaways from this exercise is how helpful the flexbox container is in designing and configuring our website, especially when we try incorporating object-oriented programming into the webapage through ids and classes. In addition to this, GitHub Pages gave us a chance to deploy our website and share it to the internet without any fees. Lastly, I know truly appreciate how helpful it is to have GitHub as it gives us a chance to work on our code on other devices and as a way to create backups and versions that we can go back to in case of emergencies.
